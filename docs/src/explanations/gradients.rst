Gradients and how we manage them
================================

Gradient samples - "special" format

first sample of gradients is "sample" that refers to the row in block.values
that we are taking the gradient of.
the other samples - what we are taking the gradient with respect to.
Write what this entails -- block.gradients.sample (i A j) (pair feature i j A k)

Cell gradients - Sample (i)
components [[x y z ] [x y z]] (displacement matrix)
